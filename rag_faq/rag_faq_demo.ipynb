A utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de m\\u00e9todos alternativos, tais como semin\\u00e1rios, trabalhos em grupo e aulas pr\\u00e1ticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno n\\u00e3o apenas receber\\u00e1 os conhecimentos t\\u00e9cnicos necess\\u00e1rios, mas tamb\\u00e9m ser\\u00e1 preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um racioc\\u00ednio cr\\u00edtico.

Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares s\\u00e3o oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: \\u25cf Programas de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica e Tecnol\\u00f3gica: os alunos do ICMC t\\u00eam a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de bolsas de inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o cient\\u00edfica e tecnol\\u00f3gica oferecidas por ag\\u00eancias governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acad\\u00eamico e com determinada renda familiar tamb\\u00e9m podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de perman\\u00eancia estudantil e com fins variados (como \\u201censino\\u201d e \\u201ccultura e extens\\u00e3o\\u201d), em conson\\u00e2ncia com a pol\\u00edtica de inclus\\u00e3o da USP. Existem tamb\\u00e9m nos departamentos de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Programas institucionais de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que n\\u00e3o obt\\u00eam bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de experi\\u00eancia no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. \\u25cf Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de ensino, pesquisa e extens\\u00e3o para a melhor forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos. Os objetivos b\\u00e1sicos do Grupo PET s\\u00e3o a diversifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o da forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos, o oferecimento de condi\\u00e7\\u00f5es especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promo\\u00e7\\u00e3o de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o e a dissemina\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a exist\\u00eancia do grupo PET \\u00e9 relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo s\\u00e3o abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de semin\\u00e1rios, conversas informais, etc. \\u25cf Semana da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e pain\\u00e9is. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espa\\u00e7o para discuss\\u00f5es de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo\\\\n\\\\n8 desenvolvidos, principalmente, nos Departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o do ICMC. \\u25cf Empresa J\\u00fanior: a ICMC J\\u00fanior \\u00e9 uma empresa sem fins lucrativos, formada por alunos da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, com o objetivo de complementar a forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o do aluno por meio do contato com o mercado de trabalho e com a administra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de uma empresa. A empresa J\\u00fanior \\u00e9 acompanhada por um docente do ICMC USP, mas gerenciada pelos alunos, sendo que eles se responsabilizam pela administra\\u00e7\\u00e3o e pelo desenvolvimento de projetos. \\u25cf Tutoriais para a gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o: os Tutoriais da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o t\\u00eam como objetivo a apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de semin\\u00e1rios e de discuss\\u00f5es que consideram t\\u00f3picos gerais e b\\u00e1sicos, acess\\u00edveis aos alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Normalmente, os tutoriais acontecem quinzenalmente e contam com um p\\u00fablico significativo, constitu\\u00eddo de alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de p\\u00f3s gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, tanto do ICMC como de outras unidades da USP e de outras institui\\u00e7\\u00f5es de S\\u00e3o Carlos. \\u25cf Participa\\u00e7\\u00e3o em Eventos Cient\\u00edficos: os Departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o incentivam a participa\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos do Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o nos principais eventos cient\\u00edficos da \\u00e1rea de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Por exemplo, regularmente, os alunos participam do SIICUSP (Simp\\u00f3sio Internacional de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica da USP) e de eventos institucionais e aqueles relacionados \\u00e0s competi\\u00e7\\u00f5es de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, entre outros. \\u25cf Monitoria: as disciplinas do curso podem ser tamb\\u00e9m um contexto prof\\u00edcuo para que os alunos exercitem um refor\\u00e7o do conte\\u00fado e transmitam os conhecimentos j\\u00e1 adquiridos aos seus colegas. Assim, a atividade de monitoria engloba o acompanhamento de uma disciplina junto com o docente respons\\u00e1vel, auxiliando em aulas de exerc\\u00edcio, corre\\u00e7\\u00e3o de trabalhos e listas de exerc\\u00edcios, bem como oferecendo plant\\u00e3o para esclarecimento de d\\u00favidas. \\u25cf Competi\\u00e7\\u00f5es de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o: por meio de treinamento em hor\\u00e1rio extracurricular e oferecimentos de disciplinas espec\\u00edficas para esta finalidade, os alunos t\\u00eam a possibilidade de engajamento nos torneios de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o em n\\u00edvel nacional e internacional. Al\\u00e9m do est\\u00edmulo ao trabalho em grupo, o aluno tem a oportunidade de aprender e aprofundar os conhecimentos em paradigmas de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o mais avan\\u00e7ados. \\u25cf Internacionaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o: os alunos do ICMC t\\u00eam \\u00e0 disposi\\u00e7\\u00e3o uma comiss\\u00e3o que lhes auxilia cursar, em universidades estrangeiras conveniadas, disciplinas de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o que podem ser aproveitadas como equivalentes ou optativas em seus cursos. Essa \\u00e9 uma experi\\u00eancia enriquecedora tanto do ponto de vista acad\\u00eamico cient\\u00edfico quanto pessoal. Como se percebe, a metodologia de ensino do Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o n\\u00e3o est\\u00e1 restrita \\u00e0s atividades desenvolvidas em sala de aula.

A partir de 2012, um novo programa de tutoria tamb\\u00e9m foi proposto. Essa tutoria, entretanto, tem sido mantida apenas para os alunos ingressantes de cada ano, no 1\\u00ba semestre, usualmente. Diferentemente da tutoria de turma, citada anteriormente, essa tutoria \\u00e9 mais pontual, consistindo em se ter pequenos grupos de alunos que se encontram regularmente com um docente de seu curso (previamente selecionado pela coordena\\u00e7\\u00e3o do curso), com a finalidade de se tirar d\\u00favidas e ter orienta\\u00e7\\u00f5es sobre o andamento do curso, que, no 1\\u00ba semestre, costuma ser impactante para o aluno ingressante, dadas as diferen\\u00e7as de rotina e formas de estudo entre o ensino m\\u00e9dio e o superior. Essa tutoria mais pontual, em conjunto com a tutoria da turma, t\\u00eam sido muito importante para os alunos. Por fim, tamb\\u00e9m tem sido realizada uma s\\u00e9rie de workshops dos cursos e da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Esta iniciativa, realizada sob a responsabilidade das coordena\\u00e7\\u00f5es dos cursos e da Comiss\\u00e3o de Gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, juntamente com os alunos, foi uma resposta aos anseios dos estudantes e dos professores envolvidos com os cursos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, para analisarem as quest\\u00f5es relativas aos temas de estrutura curricular, infraestrutura, did\\u00e1tica e tutoria, atividades extracurriculares e comportamento dos alunos e professores, dentre outros. Em geral, esses workshops s\\u00e3o muito produtivos e apontam formas de se melhorar ainda mais os cursos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o.

Em relação aos 2 primeiros núcleos, diretamente relacionados aos conteúdos de computação, pode se ver na organização geral que as disciplinas de “fundamentos da computação” encontram se principalmente nos 2 primeiros anos do curso, enquanto as de “tecnologias da computação” estão principalmente nos 2 anos seguintes. Os demais núcleos estão distribuídos nos vários anos do curso. O último ano, em particular, é dedicado principalmente para o desenvolvimento de trabalho de fim de curso, qualquer que seja sua natureza.

No primeiro estrato, de disciplinas “básicas”/“essenciais”, encontram se todas as disciplinas obrigatórias, que todos os alunos devem cursar para obterem uma formação sólida na área de computação. No segundo estrato, de disciplinas de “especialização”, os alunos podem encontrar conteúdos aprofundados nas várias áreas da computação, que são de grande relevância e que atendem demandas de mercado e da academia, oferecidos na forma de disciplinas optativas que são sempre ofertadas pelos departamentos envolvidos no curso. No último estrato, de disciplinas “complementares”, encontram se disciplinas optativas variáveis que complementam a formação do aluno e lhes permitem obter formações diferenciadas, em função de seus desejos e aptidões. O elenco de disciplinas complementares ofertado em cada ano é eleito, via votação, pelos alunos do perfil correspondente (em geral, são alunos que cursarão o 4º ano do curso, quando essas disciplinas complementares são ofertadas). No 5º ano do curso, que corresponde aos últimos dois semestres, está previsto para os alunos realizarem as disciplinas de estágio ou trabalhos de conclusão de curso, sendo que os alunos podem realizar até o limite de 40 horas semanais de estágio nestes semestres, pois não estão previstas outras disciplinas presenciais. No geral, o aluno deve cursar 241 créditos, que totalizam 4575 horas de estudo, distribuídos em: ● 211 créditos obrigatórios, compostos por 147 créditos aula e 64 créditos trabalho; ● 30 créditos aula em disciplinas optativas (do segundo ou do terceiro estrato de disciplinas). Até o máximo de 10 créditos aula de disciplinas optativas livres, desde que não tenham conteúdo semelhante ao de disciplinas obrigatórias, podem ser utilizados para o cômputo dos créditos de disciplinas optativas eletivas. Além dos créditos em disciplinas obrigatórias e optativas, o aluno deve cumprir, ao longo do curso, 90 horas de Atividades Acadêmicas Complementares (AACs) correspondentes a 3 créditos trabalho.

Evolução e Avaliação do Curso 5.1 História e evolução do curso O curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação do ICMC USP/São Carlos foi criado em 1979 pelo Departamento de Ciências de Computação e Estatística, que contava com docentes oriundos de diversos departamentos da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos (EESC USP). Atualmente está sob a responsabilidade da Comissão Coordenadora de Curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação (CoC BCC), composta em sua maioria por docentes dos Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação do ICMC USP. A CoC BCC é um colegiado subordinado à Comissão de Graduação (CG) do ICMC USP. Foi criada em abril de 2008, com os objetivos de: a) Propor à CG do ICMC a estrutura curricular do Curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, ouvidos os Departamentos pertinentes; b) Propor à CG os programas de ensino das disciplinas ministradas no curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação e acompanhar sua execução; c) Analisar a pertinência do conteúdo programático de cada disciplina, promovendo a integração das diferentes disciplinas que compõem o currículo; d) Promover o aperfeiçoamento constante do ensino no que diz respeito à adequação curricular, melhoria de laboratórios didáticos, biblioteca e recursos didático pedagógicos; e) Opinar sobre aplicação dos recursos financeiros destinados ao curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação; f) Assessorar a elaboração do horário de aulas das disciplinas de cada semestre letivo; g) Exercer as demais funções que lhe forem atribuídas pelos órgãos superiores do ICMC e da USP; h) Convidar, com a devida aprovação dos membros da CoC BCC, por sugestão da coordenação da CoC BCC, ou de algum de seus membros, docentes representando outros departamentos de outras unidades de ensino e pesquisa da USP, que ministrem disciplinas no curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, com direito a voz. Atualmente, os Departamentos de Ciências de Computação (SCC) e de Sistemas de Computação (SSC) contam juntos com aproximadamente 50 docentes com, no mínimo, título de doutor. Além de serem os principais responsáveis pelo curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, esses dois departamentos também são responsáveis pelos cursos de Bacharelado em Sistemas de Informação e pelo curso de Engenharia de Computação (em parceria com a EESC USP), assim como pelo programa de mestrado e doutorado da área de computação (Programa de Pós Graduação de Ciências de Computação e Matemática Computacional CCMC), que é de alto nível científico, reconhecido como um dos melhores do país, sendo de nível 6 na CAPES. O Bacharelado em Ciências da Computação formou 1929 alunos até o momento (final de 2022), contando atualmente com cerca de 522 alunos regularmente matriculados. Até o ano de 2002, eram oferecidas 40 vagas anuais no vestibular para o curso. O aumento de vagas (para 100) em 2003 refletiu uma resposta à ótima formação que o curso tem proporcionado aos seus alunos e à demanda da sociedade e do mercado por mais profissionais da área de computação.

Estruturação do Curso Seguindo se o currículo de referência da área, recomendado pela Sociedade Brasileira de Computação, as disciplinas do curso podem ser divididas nos núcleos de “fundamentos da computação”, “tecnologias da computação”, “matemática”, “ciências básicas”, “eletrônica” e “contexto social e profissional”. Em relação aos 2 primeiros núcleos, diretamente relacionados aos conteúdos de computação, pode se ver na organização geral que as disciplinas de “fundamentos da computação” encontram se principalmente nos 2 primeiros anos do curso, enquanto as de “tecnologias da computação” estão principalmente nos 2 anos seguintes. Os demais núcleos estão distribuídos nos vários anos do curso. O último ano, em particular, é dedicado principalmente para o desenvolvimento de trabalho de fim de curso, qualquer que seja sua natureza. Sob a ótica do currículo de referência internacional mais recente, recomendado pelas entidades IEEE e ACM, o curso pode ser estratificado em 3 estratos, relacionados às disciplinas “básicas”/“essenciais” (corresponde ao que o currículo de referência da IEEE/ACM chama de Core Tier 1), de “especialização” (Core Tier 2) e “complementares” (Electives), respectivamente. No primeiro estrato, de disciplinas “básicas”/“essenciais”, encontram se todas as disciplinas obrigatórias, que todos os alunos devem cursar para obterem uma formação sólida na área de computação. No segundo estrato, de disciplinas de “especialização”, os alunos podem encontrar conteúdos aprofundados nas várias áreas da computação, que são de grande relevância e que atendem demandas de mercado e da academia, oferecidos na forma de disciplinas optativas que são sempre ofertadas pelos departamentos envolvidos no curso. No último estrato, de disciplinas “complementares”, encontram se disciplinas optativas variáveis que complementam a formação do aluno e lhes permitem obter formações diferenciadas, em função de seus desejos e aptidões. O elenco de disciplinas complementares ofertado em cada ano é eleito, via votação, pelos alunos do perfil correspondente (em geral, são alunos que cursarão o 4º ano do curso, quando essas disciplinas complementares são ofertadas). No 5º ano do curso, que corresponde aos últimos dois semestres, está previsto para os alunos realizarem as disciplinas de estágio ou trabalhos de conclusão de curso, sendo que os alunos podem realizar até o limite de 40 horas semanais de estágio nestes semestres, pois não estão previstas outras disciplinas presenciais. No geral, o aluno deve cursar 241 créditos, que totalizam 4575 horas de estudo, distribuídos em: ● 211 créditos obrigatórios, compostos por 147 créditos aula e 64 créditos trabalho; ● 30 créditos aula em disciplinas optativas (do segundo ou do terceiro estrato de disciplinas). Até o máximo de 10 créditos aula de disciplinas optativas livres, desde que não tenham conteúdo semelhante ao de disciplinas obrigatórias, podem ser utilizados para o cômputo dos créditos de disciplinas optativas eletivas. Além dos créditos em disciplinas obrigatórias e optativas, o aluno deve cumprir, ao longo do curso, 90 horas de Atividades Acadêmicas Complementares (AACs) correspondentes a 3 créditos trabalho. Devem também ser cumpridas 466,5 horas de atividades de extensão que correspondem a 10% (dez por cento) do total da carga horária curricular, em atendimento ao Plano Nacional de Educação (PNE), regulamentado pela Resolução CNE/CES n° 7/2018 e Deliberação CEE 216/2023.\\n\\n26 5. Evolução e Avaliação do Curso 5.1 História e evolução do curso O curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação do ICMC USP/São Carlos foi criado em 1979 pelo Departamento de Ciências de Computação e Estatística, que contava com docentes oriundos de diversos departamentos da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos (EESC USP). Atualmente está sob a responsabilidade da Comissão Coordenadora de Curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação (CoC BCC), composta em sua maioria por docentes dos Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação do ICMC USP. A CoC BCC é um colegiado subordinado à Comissão de Graduação (CG) do ICMC USP. Foi criada em abril de 2008, com os objetivos de: a) Propor à CG do ICMC a estrutura curricular do Curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, ouvidos os Departamentos pertinentes; b) Propor à CG os programas de ensino das disciplinas ministradas no curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação e acompanhar sua execução; c) Analisar a pertinência do conteúdo programático de cada disciplina, promovendo a integração das diferentes disciplinas que compõem o currículo; d) Promover o aperfeiçoamento constante do ensino no que diz respeito à adequação curricular, melhoria de laboratórios didáticos, biblioteca e recursos didático pedagógicos; e) Opinar sobre aplicação dos recursos financeiros destinados ao curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação; f) Assessorar a elaboração do horário de aulas das disciplinas de cada semestre letivo; g) Exercer as demais funções que lhe forem atribuídas pelos órgãos superiores do ICMC e da USP; h) Convidar, com a devida aprovação dos membros da CoC BCC, por sugestão da coordenação da CoC BCC, ou de algum de seus membros, docentes representando outros departamentos de outras unidades de ensino e pesquisa da USP, que ministrem disciplinas no curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, com direito a voz. Atualmente, os Departamentos de Ciências de Computação (SCC) e de Sistemas de Computação (SSC) contam juntos com aproximadamente 50 docentes com, no mínimo, título de doutor. Além de serem os principais responsáveis pelo curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação, esses dois departamentos também são responsáveis pelos cursos de Bacharelado em Sistemas de Informação e pelo curso de Engenharia de Computação (em parceria com a EESC USP), assim como pelo programa de mestrado e doutorado da área de computação (Programa de Pós Graduação de Ciências de Computação e Matemática Computacional CCMC), que é de alto nível científico, reconhecido como um dos melhores do país, sendo de nível 6 na CAPES. O Bacharelado em Ciências da Computação formou 1929 alunos até o momento (final de 2022), contando atualmente com cerca de 522 alunos regularmente matriculados. Até o ano de 2002, eram oferecidas 40 vagas anuais no vestibular para o curso. O aumento de vagas (para 100) em 2003 refletiu uma resposta à ótima formação que o curso tem proporcionado aos seus alunos e à demanda da sociedade e do mercado por mais profissionais da área de computação.

Metodologia do Curso A estrutura curricular do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação é composta, principalmente, por disciplinas oferecidas pelos Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação do ICMC USP. Os Departamentos de Matemática, de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística, bem como o Departamento de Física da USP/São Carlos, são também responsáveis por algumas disciplinas do curso. Cada um dos aspectos da formação que se deseja dar ao egresso será desenvolvido por meio de um conjunto de disciplinas, ministradas por um ou mais dos departamentos citados no parágrafo anterior. A grade completa do curso é mostrada no Apêndice 1, dividida por semestres, com quantidade de créditos e indicação de pré requisitos para cada disciplina. O Apêndice 2, por sua vez, mostra o esquema da estrutura curricular, exibindo o conjunto de disciplinas a ser cursado em cada período do curso e os pré requisitos existentes entre elas (se uma disciplina aponta para outra, isso indica que a primeira é pré requisito para a segunda). As disciplinas são referenciadas por seus códigos, nomes completos ou seus nomes simplificados (em algumas ocasiões, os acrônimos são utilizados). Além disso, as disciplinas oferecidas por cada departamento têm cores diferenciadas, por exemplo, as disciplinas oferecidas pelos departamentos de Ciências de Computação e Sistemas de Computação têm as cores verde e azul, respectivamente. Por fim, exibem se, para cada período, o número de créditos aula, o número de créditos trabalho e a estimativa de quantidade de horas que o aluno deverá dedicar ao curso no período em questão. Ressalta se que cada crédito aula equivale aproximadamente a 15h de estudo em um período, enquanto um crédito trabalho equivale ao dobro disso, ou seja, a 30h em um período. Nos quatro primeiros períodos do curso, o aluno será introduzido principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de fundamentos de computação, além de grande parte do conteúdo matemático e físico necessário ao curso. Em seguida, nos quatro próximos períodos, o aluno será apresentado principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de tecnologias de computação, com disciplinas específicas de cada uma das grandes áreas da computação, além de poder eleger um conjunto de disciplinas optativas para cursar. As disciplinas optativas visam oferecer ao aluno a oportunidade de conhecer novas áreas da computação, bem como aprofundar seus conhecimentos em áreas já conhecidas. Algumas optativas também visam complementar a formação técnica, preparando um profissional capaz de administrar negócios de computação, bem como de atuar como empreendedor ou cientista. A escolha dessas disciplinas deve ser feita considerando se a área em que o egresso pretende atuar. Salienta se que, embora seja nesses períodos a concentração de todas as optativas do curso, nada impede que o aluno antecipe para os períodos anteriores ou postergue para os próximos períodos algumas delas. Por fim, nos dois últimos períodos, o aluno terá a chance de realizar estágio supervisionado em empresa conveniada ao ICMC USP e vivenciar a rotina no mercado de trabalho, ou, alternativamente, desenvolver um projeto de graduação na universidade, sob supervisão de um docente, e vivenciar a rotina acadêmica. Além disso, essas opções também podem ser realizadas no exterior, em período de intercâmbio. O conjunto de disciplinas obrigatórias e optativas do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação apresenta uma grande diversidade de conteúdo, o que requer a utilização de diferentes métodos para promover a transferência de conhecimento necessária. Dentre os métodos utilizados estão:\\n\\n7 ● Aulas expositivas convencionais; ● Aulas expositivas apoiadas por equipamentos audiovisuais que possibilitam a demonstração dos conceitos; ● Aulas em laboratório de software e hardware, onde são desenvolvidas atividades práticas relacionadas aos conceitos adquiridos; ● Apresentação de seminários e elaboração de monografias, visando tanto uma participação mais efetiva do aluno na sala de aula como a capacitação de sua expressão oral e escrita. A utilização de métodos alternativos, tais como seminários, trabalhos em grupo e aulas práticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno não apenas receberá os conhecimentos técnicos necessários, mas também será preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um raciocínio crítico. Apesar da utilização de diferentes métodos de ensino, apenas as disciplinas não são suficientes para promover toda a formação necessária. Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares são oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: ● Programas de Iniciação Científica e Tecnológica: os alunos do ICMC têm a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obtenção de bolsas de iniciação científica e tecnológica oferecidas por agências governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar também podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de permanência estudantil e com fins variados (como “ensino” e “cultura e extensão”), em consonância com a política de inclusão da USP. Existem também nos departamentos de computação Programas institucionais de Iniciação Científica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obtenção de experiência no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. ● Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educação Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integração de ensino, pesquisa e extensão para a melhor formação dos alunos. Os objetivos básicos do Grupo PET são a diversificação da formação dos alunos, o oferecimento de condições especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promoção de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de graduação e a disseminação dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a existência do grupo PET é relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da graduação, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo são abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de seminários, conversas informais, etc. ● Semana da Computação: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computação. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e painéis. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espaço para discussões de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresentação de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo', 'length': 7012, 'num_tokens': 1067} \n",

A partir de 2012, um novo programa de tutoria também foi proposto. Essa tutoria, entretanto, tem sido mantida apenas para os alunos ingressantes de cada ano, no 1º semestre, usualmente. Diferentemente da tutoria de turma, citada anteriormente, essa tutoria é mais pontual, consistindo em se ter pequenos grupos de alunos que se encontram regularmente com um docente de seu curso (previamente selecionado pela coordenação do curso), com a finalidade de se tirar dúvidas e ter orientações sobre o andamento do curso, que, no 1º semestre, costuma ser impactante para o aluno ingressante, dadas as diferenças de rotina e formas de estudo entre o ensino médio e o superior. Essa tutoria mais pontual, em conjunto com a tutoria da turma, têm sido muito importante para os alunos. Por fim, também tem sido realizada uma série de workshops dos cursos e da graduação. Esta iniciativa, realizada sob a responsabilidade das coordenações dos cursos e da Comissão de Graduação, juntamente com os alunos, foi uma resposta aos anseios dos estudantes e dos professores envolvidos com os cursos de graduação, para analisarem as questões relativas aos temas de estrutura curricular, infraestrutura, didática e tutoria, atividades extracurriculares e comportamento dos alunos e professores, dentre outros. Em geral, esses workshops são muito produtivos e apontam formas de se melhorar ainda mais os cursos de graduação. Acompanhamento de egressos Atualmente existe disponível no sítio da USP, o sistema Alumni USP (http://www.alumni.usp.br/), que é um sistema de controle de egressos em que ex alunos de outros cursos podem efetuar cadastro e assim manter a ligação com o ICMC e com a USP.\\n\\n32 Apêndice – Grade Curricular* Disciplinas (sequência aconselhada) C = Disciplina Conjunto 1o Período Letivo Créditos aula Créditos trabalho Requisitos SCC 200 Informação Profissional em Ciências da Computação 2 0 SCC 221 Introdução à Ciência de Computação I 4 1 SCC 222 Laboratório de Introdução à Ciência de Computação I 2 2 SMA 300 Geometria Analítica 4 0 SMA 353 Cálculo I 4 0 SSC 104 Evolução Histórica da Computação 2 1 SSC 117 Introdução à Lógica Digital 2 1 SSC 119 Prática em Lógica Digital 2 1 SSC 180 Eletrônica para Computação 2 2 24 8 2o Período Letivo 7600105 Física Básica I 4 0 SMA 353 SCC 201 Introdução à Ciência de Computação II 4 2 SCC 221 SCC 202 Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados I 4 2 SCC 201 C SMA 180 Matemática Discreta I 4 0 SMA 354 Cálculo II 4 0 SMA 353 SSC 118 Sistemas Digitais 2 1 SSC 117 SSC 108 Prática em Sistemas Digitais 2 1 SSC 118 C 24 6 3o Período Letivo 7600109 Laboratório de Física Geral I 2 0 7600105 SCC 215 Organização de Arquivos 3 2 SCC201, SCC 202 SCC 216 Modelagem Computacional em Grafos 2 1 SCC 202 SMA 355 Cálculo III 4 0 SMA 354 SSC 103 Programação Orientada a Objetos 2 1 SCC 202 SSC 902 Organização e Arquitetura de Computadores SSC 960 Programação Funcional 4 2 1 1 SSC 118 SCC 202 19 6 4o Período Letivo SCC 218 Algoritmos Avançados e Aplicações 2 2 SCC 216 SME 123 Estatística 4 0 SMA 354 SME 142 Álgebra Linear e Aplicações 4 1 SSC 124 Análise e Projeto Orientado a Objetos 2 1 SSC 103 SSC 140 Sistemas Operacionais I 4 2 SSC 902, SCC 202 16 6 5o Período Letivo SCC 219 Introdução ao Desenvolvimento Web 4 1 SCC 202 SCC 240 Bases de Dados 4 2 SCC 215 SME 104 Cálculo Numérico 4 0 SMA 353, SME 141 SME 121 Processos Estocásticos 4 0 SME 123 SSC 130 Engenharia de Software 4 1 SSC 124 SSC 142 Redes de Computadores 4 2 SSC 140 24 6', 'length': 3504, 'num_tokens': 622} \n",
