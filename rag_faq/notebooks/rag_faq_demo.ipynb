Metodologia do Curso A estrutura curricular do curso de Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00e9 composta, principalmente, por disciplinas oferecidas pelos Departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o do ICMC USP. Os Departamentos de Matem\\u00e1tica, de Matem\\u00e1tica Aplicada e Estat\\u00edstica, bem como o Departamento de F\\u00edsica da USP/S\\u00e3o Carlos, s\\u00e3o tamb\\u00e9m respons\\u00e1veis por algumas disciplinas do curso. Cada um dos aspectos da forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o que se deseja dar ao egresso ser\\u00e1 desenvolvido por meio de um conjunto de disciplinas, ministradas por um ou mais dos departamentos citados no par\\u00e1grafo anterior. A grade completa do curso \\u00e9 mostrada no Ap\\u00eandice 1, dividida por semestres, com quantidade de cr\\u00e9ditos e indica\\u00e7\\u00e3o de pr\\u00e9 requisitos para cada disciplina. O Ap\\u00eandice 2, por sua vez, mostra o esquema da estrutura curricular, exibindo o conjunto de disciplinas a ser cursado em cada per\\u00edodo do curso e os pr\\u00e9 requisitos existentes entre elas (se uma disciplina aponta para outra, isso indica que a primeira \\u00e9 pr\\u00e9 requisito para a segunda). As disciplinas s\\u00e3o referenciadas por seus c\\u00f3digos, nomes completos ou seus nomes simplificados (em algumas ocasi\\u00f5es, os acr\\u00f4nimos s\\u00e3o utilizados). Al\\u00e9m disso, as disciplinas oferecidas por cada departamento t\\u00eam cores diferenciadas, por exemplo, as disciplinas oferecidas pelos departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o t\\u00eam as cores verde e azul, respectivamente. Por fim, exibem se, para cada per\\u00edodo, o n\\u00famero de cr\\u00e9ditos aula, o n\\u00famero de cr\\u00e9ditos trabalho e a estimativa de quantidade de horas que o aluno dever\\u00e1 dedicar ao curso no per\\u00edodo em quest\\u00e3o. Ressalta se que cada cr\\u00e9dito aula equivale aproximadamente a 15h de estudo em um per\\u00edodo, enquanto um cr\\u00e9dito trabalho equivale ao dobro disso, ou seja, a 30h em um per\\u00edodo. Nos quatro primeiros per\\u00edodos do curso, o aluno ser\\u00e1 introduzido principalmente ao n\\u00facleo de disciplinas de fundamentos de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, al\\u00e9m de grande parte do conte\\u00fado matem\\u00e1tico e f\\u00edsico necess\\u00e1rio ao curso. Em seguida, nos quatro pr\\u00f3ximos per\\u00edodos, o aluno ser\\u00e1 apresentado principalmente ao n\\u00facleo de disciplinas de tecnologias de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, com disciplinas espec\\u00edficas de cada uma das grandes \\u00e1reas da computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, al\\u00e9m de poder eleger um conjunto de disciplinas optativas para cursar. As disciplinas optativas visam oferecer ao aluno a oportunidade de conhecer novas \\u00e1reas da computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, bem como aprofundar seus conhecimentos em \\u00e1reas j\\u00e1 conhecidas. Algumas optativas tamb\\u00e9m visam complementar a forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o t\\u00e9cnica, preparando um profissional capaz de administrar neg\\u00f3cios de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, bem como de atuar como empreendedor ou cientista. A escolha dessas disciplinas deve ser feita considerando se a \\u00e1rea em que o egresso pretende atuar. Salienta se que, embora seja nesses per\\u00edodos a concentra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de todas as optativas do curso, nada impede que o aluno antecipe para os per\\u00edodos anteriores ou postergue para os pr\\u00f3ximos per\\u00edodos algumas delas. Por fim, nos dois \\u00faltimos per\\u00edodos, o aluno ter\\u00e1 a chance de realizar est\\u00e1gio supervisionado em empresa conveniada ao ICMC USP e vivenciar a rotina no mercado de trabalho, ou, alternativamente, desenvolver um projeto de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o na universidade, sob supervis\\u00e3o de um docente, e vivenciar a rotina acad\\u00eamica. Al\\u00e9m disso, essas op\\u00e7\\u00f5es tamb\\u00e9m podem ser realizadas no exterior, em per\\u00edodo de interc\\u00e2mbio. O conjunto de disciplinas obrigat\\u00f3rias e optativas do curso de Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o apresenta uma grande diversidade de conte\\u00fado, o que requer a utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de diferentes m\\u00e9todos para promover a transfer\\u00eancia de conhecimento necess\\u00e1ria. Dentre os m\\u00e9todos utilizados est\\u00e3o:\\n\\n7 \\u25cf Aulas expositivas convencionais; \\u25cf Aulas expositivas apoiadas por equipamentos audiovisuais que possibilitam a demonstra\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos conceitos; \\u25cf Aulas em laborat\\u00f3rio de software e hardware, onde s\\u00e3o desenvolvidas atividades pr\\u00e1ticas relacionadas aos conceitos adquiridos; \\u25cf Apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de semin\\u00e1rios e elabora\\u00e7\\u00e3o de monografias, visando tanto uma participa\\u00e7\\u00e3o mais efetiva do aluno na sala de aula como a capacita\\u00e7\\u00e3o de sua express\\u00e3o oral e escrita. A utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de m\\u00e9todos alternativos, tais como semin\\u00e1rios, trabalhos em grupo e aulas pr\\u00e1ticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno n\\u00e3o apenas receber\\u00e1 os conhecimentos t\\u00e9cnicos necess\\u00e1rios, mas tamb\\u00e9m ser\\u00e1 preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um racioc\\u00ednio cr\\u00edtico. Apesar da utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de diferentes m\\u00e9todos de ensino, apenas as disciplinas n\\u00e3o s\\u00e3o suficientes para promover toda a forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o necess\\u00e1ria. Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares s\\u00e3o oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: \\u25cf Programas de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica e Tecnol\\u00f3gica: os alunos do ICMC t\\u00eam a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de bolsas de inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o cient\\u00edfica e tecnol\\u00f3gica oferecidas por ag\\u00eancias governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acad\\u00eamico e com determinada renda familiar tamb\\u00e9m podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de perman\\u00eancia estudantil e com fins variados (como \\u201censino\\u201d e \\u201ccultura e extens\\u00e3o\\u201d), em conson\\u00e2ncia com a pol\\u00edtica de inclus\\u00e3o da USP. Existem tamb\\u00e9m nos departamentos de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Programas institucionais de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que n\\u00e3o obt\\u00eam bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de experi\\u00eancia no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. \\u25cf Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de ensino, pesquisa e extens\\u00e3o para a melhor forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos. Os objetivos b\\u00e1sicos do Grupo PET s\\u00e3o a diversifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o da forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos, o oferecimento de condi\\u00e7\\u00f5es especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promo\\u00e7\\u00e3o de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o e a dissemina\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a exist\\u00eancia do grupo PET \\u00e9 relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo s\\u00e3o abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de semin\\u00e1rios, conversas informais, etc. \\u25cf Semana da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e pain\\u00e9is. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espa\\u00e7o para discuss\\u00f5es de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 6,\n        \"max\": 27,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          27,\n          26,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Em que anos houve uma queda da evas\\u00e3o nos \\u00faltimos 3 anos do curso?\",\n          \"Qual \\u00e9 o n\\u00famero de vagas anuais oferecidas no vestibular para o curso a partir de 2021?\",\n          \"Qual \\u00e9 o papel da Semana da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2021, 2022 e 2023\",\n          \"A partir de 2021, o total de vagas do curso passou de 100 para 85.\",\n          \"A Semana da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00e9 um evento anual que promove palestras, minicursos e pain\\u00e9is, aberto \\u00e0 comunidade, para discutir assuntos de interesse e apresentar trabalhos.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"course\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancia da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"persona\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"aluno\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de m\\u00e9todos alternativos, tais como semin\\u00e1rios, trabalhos em grupo e aulas pr\\u00e1ticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno n\\u00e3o apenas receber\\u00e1 os conhecimentos t\\u00e9cnicos necess\\u00e1rios, mas tamb\\u00e9m ser\\u00e1 preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um racioc\\u00ednio cr\\u00edtico. Apesar da utiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o de diferentes m\\u00e9todos de ensino, apenas as disciplinas n\\u00e3o s\\u00e3o suficientes para promover toda a forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o necess\\u00e1ria. Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares s\\u00e3o oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: \\u25cf Programas de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica e Tecnol\\u00f3gica: os alunos do ICMC t\\u00eam a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de bolsas de inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o cient\\u00edfica e tecnol\\u00f3gica oferecidas por ag\\u00eancias governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acad\\u00eamico e com determinada renda familiar tamb\\u00e9m podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de perman\\u00eancia estudantil e com fins variados (como \\u201censino\\u201d e \\u201ccultura e extens\\u00e3o\\u201d), em conson\\u00e2ncia com a pol\\u00edtica de inclus\\u00e3o da USP. Existem tamb\\u00e9m nos departamentos de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Programas institucionais de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que n\\u00e3o obt\\u00eam bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obten\\u00e7\\u00e3o de experi\\u00eancia no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. \\u25cf Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educa\\u00e7\\u00e3o Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de ensino, pesquisa e extens\\u00e3o para a melhor forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos. Os objetivos b\\u00e1sicos do Grupo PET s\\u00e3o a diversifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o da forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos, o oferecimento de condi\\u00e7\\u00f5es especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promo\\u00e7\\u00e3o de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o e a dissemina\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a exist\\u00eancia do grupo PET \\u00e9 relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo s\\u00e3o abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de semin\\u00e1rios, conversas informais, etc. \\u25cf Semana da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e pain\\u00e9is. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espa\\u00e7o para discuss\\u00f5es de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo\\n\\n8 desenvolvidos, principalmente, nos Departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o do ICMC. \\u25cf Empresa J\\u00fanior: a ICMC J\\u00fanior \\u00e9 uma empresa sem fins lucrativos, formada por alunos da gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, com o objetivo de complementar a forma\\u00e7\\u00e3o do aluno por meio do contato com o mercado de trabalho e com a administra\\u00e7\\u00e3o de uma empresa. A empresa J\\u00fanior \\u00e9 acompanhada por um docente do ICMC USP, mas gerenciada pelos alunos, sendo que eles se responsabilizam pela administra\\u00e7\\u00e3o e pelo desenvolvimento de projetos. \\u25cf Tutoriais para a gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o: os Tutoriais da Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o t\\u00eam como objetivo a apresenta\\u00e7\\u00e3o de semin\\u00e1rios e de discuss\\u00f5es que consideram t\\u00f3picos gerais e b\\u00e1sicos, acess\\u00edveis aos alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Normalmente, os tutoriais acontecem quinzenalmente e contam com um p\\u00fablico significativo, constitu\\u00eddo de alunos de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de p\\u00f3s gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o, tanto do ICMC como de outras unidades da USP e de outras institui\\u00e7\\u00f5es de S\\u00e3o Carlos. \\u25cf Participa\\u00e7\\u00e3o em Eventos Cient\\u00edficos: os Departamentos de Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o e de Sistemas de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o incentivam a participa\\u00e7\\u00e3o dos alunos do Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o nos principais eventos cient\\u00edficos da \\u00e1rea de computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Por exemplo, regularmente, os alunos participam do SIICUSP (Simp\\u00f3sio Internacional de Inicia\\u00e7\\u00e3o Cient\\u00edfica da USP) e de eventos institucionais e aqueles relacionados \\u00e0s competi\\u00e7\\u00f5es de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o, entre outros. \\u25cf Monitoria: as disciplinas do curso podem ser tamb\\u00e9m um contexto prof\\u00edcuo para que os alunos exercitem um refor\\u00e7o do conte\\u00fado e transmitam os conhecimentos j\\u00e1 adquiridos aos seus colegas. Assim, a atividade de monitoria engloba o acompanhamento de uma disciplina junto com o docente respons\\u00e1vel, auxiliando em aulas de exerc\\u00edcio, corre\\u00e7\\u00e3o de trabalhos e listas de exerc\\u00edcios, bem como oferecendo plant\\u00e3o para esclarecimento de d\\u00favidas. \\u25cf Competi\\u00e7\\u00f5es de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o: por meio de treinamento em hor\\u00e1rio extracurricular e oferecimentos de disciplinas espec\\u00edficas para esta finalidade, os alunos t\\u00eam a possibilidade de engajamento nos torneios de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o em n\\u00edvel nacional e internacional. Al\\u00e9m do est\\u00edmulo ao trabalho em grupo, o aluno tem a oportunidade de aprender e aprofundar os conhecimentos em paradigmas de programa\\u00e7\\u00e3o mais avan\\u00e7ados. \\u25cf Internacionaliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o: os alunos do ICMC t\\u00eam \\u00e0 disposi\\u00e7\\u00e3o uma comiss\\u00e3o que lhes auxilia cursar, em universidades estrangeiras conveniadas, disciplinas de gradua\\u00e7\\u00e3o que podem ser aproveitadas como equivalentes ou optativas em seus cursos. Essa \\u00e9 uma experi\\u00eancia enriquecedora tanto do ponto de vista acad\\u00eamico cient\\u00edfico quanto pessoal. Como se percebe, a metodologia de ensino do Bacharelado em Ci\\u00eancias de Computa\\u00e7\\u00e3o n\\u00e3o est\\u00e1 restrita \\u00e0s atividades desenvolvidas em sala de aula.

Metodologia do Curso A estrutura curricular do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação é composta, principalmente, por disciplinas oferecidas pelos Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação do ICMC USP. Os Departamentos de Matemática, de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística, bem como o Departamento de Física da USP/São Carlos, são também responsáveis por algumas disciplinas do curso. Cada um dos aspectos da formação que se deseja dar ao egresso será desenvolvido por meio de um conjunto de disciplinas, ministradas por um ou mais dos departamentos citados no parágrafo anterior. A grade completa do curso é mostrada no Apêndice 1, dividida por semestres, com quantidade de créditos e indicação de pré requisitos para cada disciplina. O Apêndice 2, por sua vez, mostra o esquema da estrutura curricular, exibindo o conjunto de disciplinas a ser cursado em cada período do curso e os pré requisitos existentes entre elas (se uma disciplina aponta para outra, isso indica que a primeira é pré requisito para a segunda). As disciplinas são referenciadas por seus códigos, nomes completos ou seus nomes simplificados (em algumas ocasiões, os acrônimos são utilizados). Além disso, as disciplinas oferecidas por cada departamento têm cores diferenciadas, por exemplo, as disciplinas oferecidas pelos departamentos de Ciências de Computação e Sistemas de Computação têm as cores verde e azul, respectivamente. Por fim, exibem se, para cada período, o número de créditos aula, o número de créditos trabalho e a estimativa de quantidade de horas que o aluno deverá dedicar ao curso no período em questão. Ressalta se que cada crédito aula equivale aproximadamente a 15h de estudo em um período, enquanto um crédito trabalho equivale ao dobro disso, ou seja, a 30h em um período. Nos quatro primeiros períodos do curso, o aluno será introduzido principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de fundamentos de computação, além de grande parte do conteúdo matemático e físico necessário ao curso. Em seguida, nos quatro próximos períodos, o aluno será apresentado principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de tecnologias de computação, com disciplinas específicas de cada uma das grandes áreas da computação, além de poder eleger um conjunto de disciplinas optativas para cursar. As disciplinas optativas visam oferecer ao aluno a oportunidade de conhecer novas áreas da computação, bem como aprofundar seus conhecimentos em áreas já conhecidas. Algumas optativas também visam complementar a formação técnica, preparando um profissional capaz de administrar negócios de computação, bem como de atuar como empreendedor ou cientista. A escolha dessas disciplinas deve ser feita considerando se a área em que o egresso pretende atuar. Salienta se que, embora seja nesses períodos a concentração de todas as optativas do curso, nada impede que o aluno antecipe para os períodos anteriores ou postergue para os próximos períodos algumas delas. Por fim, nos dois últimos períodos, o aluno terá a chance de realizar estágio supervisionado em empresa conveniada ao ICMC USP e vivenciar a rotina no mercado de trabalho, ou, alternativamente, desenvolver um projeto de graduação na universidade, sob supervisão de um docente, e vivenciar a rotina acadêmica. Além disso, essas opções também podem ser realizadas no exterior, em período de intercâmbio. O conjunto de disciplinas obrigatórias e optativas do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação apresenta uma grande diversidade de conteúdo, o que requer a utilização de diferentes métodos para promover a transferência de conhecimento necessária.

A utilização de métodos alternativos, tais como seminários, trabalhos em grupo e aulas práticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno não apenas receberá os conhecimentos técnicos necessários, mas também será preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um raciocínio crítico. Apesar da utilização de diferentes métodos de ensino, apenas as disciplinas não são suficientes para promover toda a formação necessária. Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares são oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: ● Programas de Iniciação Científica e Tecnológica: os alunos do ICMC têm a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obtenção de bolsas de iniciação científica e tecnológica oferecidas por agências governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar também podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de permanência estudantil e com fins variados (como “ensino” e “cultura e extensão”), em consonância com a política de inclusão da USP. Existem também nos departamentos de computação Programas institucionais de Iniciação Científica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obtenção de experiência no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. ● Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educação Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integração de ensino, pesquisa e extensão para a melhor formação dos alunos. Os objetivos básicos do Grupo PET são a diversificação da formação dos alunos, o oferecimento de condições especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promoção de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de graduação e a disseminação dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a existência do grupo PET é relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da graduação, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo são abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de seminários, conversas informais, etc. ● Semana da Computação: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computação. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e painéis. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espaço para discussões de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresentação de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo\n",

A empresa Júnior é acompanhada por um docente do ICMC USP, mas gerenciada pelos alunos, sendo que eles se responsabilizam pela administração e pelo desenvolvimento de projetos. ● Tutoriais para a graduação: os Tutoriais da Computação têm como objetivo a apresentação de seminários e de discussões que consideram tópicos gerais e básicos, acessíveis aos alunos de graduação. Normalmente, os tutoriais acontecem quinzenalmente e contam com um público significativo, constituído de alunos de graduação e de pós graduação, tanto do ICMC como de outras unidades da USP e de outras instituições de São Carlos. ● Participação em Eventos Científicos: os Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação incentivam a participação dos alunos do Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação nos principais eventos científicos da área de computação. Por exemplo, regularmente, os alunos participam do SIICUSP (Simpósio Internacional de Iniciação Científica da USP) e de eventos institucionais e aqueles relacionados às competições de programação, entre outros. ● Monitoria: as disciplinas do curso podem ser também um contexto profícuo para que os alunos exercitem um reforço do conteúdo e transmitam os conhecimentos já adquiridos aos seus colegas. Assim, a atividade de monitoria engloba o acompanhamento de uma disciplina junto com o docente responsável, auxiliando em aulas de exercício, correção de trabalhos e listas de exercícios, bem como oferecendo plantão para esclarecimento de dúvidas. ● Competições de programação: por meio de treinamento em horário extracurricular e oferecimentos de disciplinas específicas para esta finalidade, os alunos têm a possibilidade de engajamento nos torneios de programação em nível nacional e internacional. Além do estímulo ao trabalho em grupo, o aluno tem a oportunidade de aprender e aprofundar os conhecimentos em paradigmas de programação mais avançados. ● Internacionalização: os alunos do ICMC têm à disposição uma comissão que lhes auxilia cursar, em universidades estrangeiras conveniadas, disciplinas de graduação que podem ser aproveitadas como equivalentes ou optativas em seus cursos. Essa é uma experiência enriquecedora tanto do ponto de vista acadêmico científico quanto pessoal. Como se percebe, a metodologia de ensino do Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação não está restrita às atividades desenvolvidas em sala de aula. O desenvolvimento das aptidões e, em particular, de cada habilidade definida na Seção 2, é atingido tanto por meio das disciplinas como das atividades complementares.

            "\n",
            "7 ● Aulas expositivas convencionais; ● Aulas expositivas apoiadas por equipamentos audiovisuais que possibilitam a demonstração dos conceitos; ● Aulas em laboratório de software e hardware, onde são desenvolvidas atividades práticas relacionadas aos conceitos adquiridos; ● Apresentação de seminários e elaboração de monografias, visando tanto uma participação mais efetiva do aluno na sala de aula como a capacitação de sua expressão oral e escrita. A utilização de métodos alternativos, tais como seminários, trabalhos em grupo e aulas práticas, contribuem para que os alunos sejam participantes ativos do processo de ensino aprendizagem. Dessa forma, o aluno não apenas receberá os conhecimentos técnicos necessários, mas também será preparado para se tornar um profissional ativo, criativo e possuidor de um raciocínio crítico. Apesar da utilização de diferentes métodos de ensino, apenas as disciplinas não são suficientes para promover toda a formação necessária. Diferentes tipos de atividades extracurriculares são oferecidos aos alunos, tais como: ● Programas de Iniciação Científica e Tecnológica: os alunos do ICMC têm a oportunidade de participar dos grupos de pesquisa e de trabalho, com a possibilidade de obtenção de bolsas de iniciação científica e tecnológica oferecidas por agências governamentais (PIBIC, FAPESP, etc.). Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar também podem ser contemplados com as bolsas de permanência estudantil e com fins variados (como “ensino” e “cultura e extensão”), em consonância com a política de inclusão da USP. Existem também nos departamentos de computação Programas institucionais de Iniciação Científica (PIC), por meio dos quais os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores dos departamentos. O desenvolvimento desses trabalhos contribui tanto para o aprimoramento dos conhecimentos do aluno quanto para a obtenção de experiência no desenvolvimento de pesquisas e no relacionamento com pesquisadores e com outros alunos. ● Grupo PET: o curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação conta com um Grupo PET (Programa de Educação Tutorial), cujas atividades iniciaram em setembro de 1995 e focam na integração de ensino, pesquisa e extensão para a melhor formação dos alunos. Os objetivos básicos do Grupo PET são a diversificação da formação dos alunos, o oferecimento de condições especiais de desenvolvimento para os bolsistas, a promoção de atividades estendidas aos demais alunos de graduação e a disseminação dos conhecimentos dos alunos do grupo aos demais alunos do curso. Dessa forma, a existência do grupo PET é relevante tanto para os bolsistas PET (diante da oportunidade de estarem mais bem preparados para a vida profissional) como para os demais alunos da graduação, pois muitas das atividades organizadas pelo grupo são abertas aos demais alunos e o desenvolvimento dos alunos do PET pode ser repassado aos demais por meio de seminários, conversas informais, etc. ● Semana da Computação: o grupo PET promove anualmente a Semana de Computação. Essa semana conta com diversos eventos, incluindo palestras, minicursos e painéis. Esse evento atrai grande interesse e tem se destacado no campus, pois abre espaço para discussões de assuntos que interessam a toda a comunidade e para a apresentação de palestras e de trabalhos que vem sendo \n",

            "6 3. Metodologia do Curso A estrutura curricular do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação é composta, principalmente, por disciplinas oferecidas pelos Departamentos de Ciências de Computação e de Sistemas de Computação do ICMC USP. Os Departamentos de Matemática, de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística, bem como o Departamento de Física da USP/São Carlos, são também responsáveis por algumas disciplinas do curso. Cada um dos aspectos da formação que se deseja dar ao egresso será desenvolvido por meio de um conjunto de disciplinas, ministradas por um ou mais dos departamentos citados no parágrafo anterior. A grade completa do curso é mostrada no Apêndice 1, dividida por semestres, com quantidade de créditos e indicação de pré requisitos para cada disciplina. O Apêndice 2, por sua vez, mostra o esquema da estrutura curricular, exibindo o conjunto de disciplinas a ser cursado em cada período do curso e os pré requisitos existentes entre elas (se uma disciplina aponta para outra, isso indica que a primeira é pré requisito para a segunda). As disciplinas são referenciadas por seus códigos, nomes completos ou seus nomes simplificados (em algumas ocasiões, os acrônimos são utilizados). Além disso, as disciplinas oferecidas por cada departamento têm cores diferenciadas, por exemplo, as disciplinas oferecidas pelos departamentos de Ciências de Computação e Sistemas de Computação têm as cores verde e azul, respectivamente. Por fim, exibem se, para cada período, o número de créditos aula, o número de créditos trabalho e a estimativa de quantidade de horas que o aluno deverá dedicar ao curso no período em questão. Ressalta se que cada crédito aula equivale aproximadamente a 15h de estudo em um período, enquanto um crédito trabalho equivale ao dobro disso, ou seja, a 30h em um período. Nos quatro primeiros períodos do curso, o aluno será introduzido principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de fundamentos de computação, além de grande parte do conteúdo matemático e físico necessário ao curso. Em seguida, nos quatro próximos períodos, o aluno será apresentado principalmente ao núcleo de disciplinas de tecnologias de computação, com disciplinas específicas de cada uma das grandes áreas da computação, além de poder eleger um conjunto de disciplinas optativas para cursar. As disciplinas optativas visam oferecer ao aluno a oportunidade de conhecer novas áreas da computação, bem como aprofundar seus conhecimentos em áreas já conhecidas. Algumas optativas também visam complementar a formação técnica, preparando um profissional capaz de administrar negócios de computação, bem como de atuar como empreendedor ou cientista. A escolha dessas disciplinas deve ser feita considerando se a área em que o egresso pretende atuar. Salienta se que, embora seja nesses períodos a concentração de todas as optativas do curso, nada impede que o aluno antecipe para os períodos anteriores ou postergue para os próximos períodos algumas delas. Por fim, nos dois últimos períodos, o aluno terá a chance de realizar estágio supervisionado em empresa conveniada ao ICMC USP e vivenciar a rotina no mercado de trabalho, ou, alternativamente, desenvolver um projeto de graduação na universidade, sob supervisão de um docente, e vivenciar a rotina acadêmica. Além disso, essas opções também podem ser realizadas no exterior, em período de intercâmbio. O conjunto de disciplinas obrigatórias e optativas do curso de Bacharelado em Ciências de Computação apresenta uma grande diversidade de conteúdo, o que requer a utilização de diferentes métodos para promover a transferência de conhecimento necessária.

Introdução: Este Projeto Político do Curso (PPC) tem por objetivo traçar diretrizes e metas para a formação de professores de Matemática para os anos finais do Ensino Fundamental e para o Ensino Médio, no ICMC USP. Tem como base as orientações do Programa de Formação de Professores, aprovado pelo Conselho de Graduação da USP em 2004, e as Deliberações CEE N° 111/2012, CEE Nº 126/2014, Resolução CNE/CP no. 2/2015 e CEE No 154/2017. 2. Breve Histórico: O ICMC USP foi criado como unidade isolada desta universidade, desde a reforma universitária de 1971, à época designado “Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas de São Carlos – ICMSC – e hoje denominado Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação. Anteriormente a esta data, o departamento de Matemática fazia parte da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, implantada em 1948 e com início das atividades em 1953, e agregava pesquisadores da área de Matemática e Computação. Atualmente, o ICMC conta com quatro departamentos: de Sistemas da Informação (SSC), de Ciências da Computação (SCC), de Matemática (SMA) e o de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística (SME), englobando docentes pesquisadores em todas essas áreas. O campus da USP de São Carlos tem tido, historicamente, uma forte atuação na formação de profissionais das Ciências Exatas. Nesse contexto, conta com a interação com outros profissionais que utilizam a Matemática como ferramenta de seu dia a dia, como Físicos, Químicos ou Engenheiros. Por outro lado, a cidade de São Carlos tem se firmado como um polo de desenvolvimento de alta tecnologia, dentre outros fatores, devido à existência desta “vocação para as exatas”, estabelecida com a criação desse campus. Isso leva a população local a uma maior conscientização sobre a importância do ensino e da aprendizagem da Matemática, o que tem fortalecido o compromisso do ICMC em propiciar cursos de formação de professores de Matemática de alto nível, envidando esforços para a busca constante de seu aperfeiçoamento e da maior interação com a comunidade local. O curso de Licenciatura em Matemática foi reconhecido pela Portaria do MEC nº 1474, de 13/10/1992 (D.O.E. 14/10/1992). Desde então, seu reconhecimento tem sido renovado a cada 5 anos, pelo Conselho Estadual de Educação CEE/SP. 3. Relevância Social do Curso: Documentos recentes sobre o Ensino Básico no Brasil têm apontado uma grande carência de professores para esse nível educacional.

Breve Histórico: O ICMC USP foi criado como unidade isolada desta universidade, desde a reforma universitária de 1971, à época designado “Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas de São Carlos – ICMSC – e hoje denominado Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação. Anteriormente a esta data, o departamento de Matemática fazia parte da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, implantada em 1948 e com início das atividades em 1953, e agregava pesquisadores da área de Matemática e Computação. Atualmente, o ICMC conta com quatro departamentos: de Sistemas da Informação (SSC), de Ciências da Computação (SCC), de Matemática (SMA) e o de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística (SME), englobando docentes pesquisadores em todas essas áreas. O campus da USP de São Carlos tem tido, historicamente, uma forte atuação na formação de profissionais das Ciências Exatas. Nesse contexto, conta com a interação com outros profissionais que utilizam a Matemática como ferramenta de seu dia a dia, como Físicos, Químicos ou Engenheiros. Por outro lado, a cidade de São Carlos tem se firmado como um polo de desenvolvimento de alta tecnologia, dentre outros fatores, devido à existência desta “vocação para as exatas”, estabelecida com a criação desse campus. Isso leva a população local a uma maior conscientização sobre a importância do ensino e da aprendizagem da Matemática, o que tem fortalecido o compromisso do ICMC em propiciar cursos de formação de professores de Matemática de alto nível, envidando esforços para a busca constante de seu aperfeiçoamento e da maior interação com a comunidade local. O curso de Licenciatura em Matemática foi reconhecido pela Portaria do MEC nº 1474, de 13/10/1992 (D.O.E. 14/10/1992). Desde então, seu reconhecimento tem sido renovado a cada 5 anos, pelo Conselho Estadual de Educação CEE/SP. 3.

Investigar sistematicamente progressos e dificuldades dos alunos, e de sua própria prática, e utilizar tal investigação como parte do processo de sua formação continuada. 6. Processo Pedagógico 6.1. Considerações metodológicas: As disciplinas do curso de Licenciatura são ministradas segundo uma variedade de métodos de ensino e aprendizagem, cada qual dentro de suas peculiaridades. Aquelas de formação mais teórica, em geral, utilizam se de aulas expositivas, mas não dispensam o uso de equipamentos como projetores de imagens, microcomputadores (como é o caso dos Cálculos), ambientes virtuais de aprendizagem (A.V.A.) ou outros, viabilizando situações concretas (simuladas) dos conceitos abstratos, com fundamental importância para a sólida formação básica do aluno. Muitas das disciplinas listadas na estrutura curricular da Licenciatura em Matemática, principalmente aquelas voltadas à formação pedagógica do futuro professor, possibilitam o desenvolvimento de diversas atividades práticas desenvolvidas no Laboratório Interdisciplinar de Formação de Educadores LIFE e Laboratório de Ensino de Matemática LEM, simulando situações reais de ensino, junto a alunos da Rede Oficial de Ensino Fundamental e Médio que visitam o ICMC, para atenderem a minicursos, palestras, ou orientações em Matemática, ou executando as junto a tais alunos em suas unidades escolares. Outros recursos metodológicos seminários, monografias, relatos, estudos de caso – estão presentes em várias disciplinas, em eventos para os alunos de graduação como o SIM (Simpósio de Matemática para a Graduação – organizado anualmente), os seminários mensais de graduação (Colóquios das Licenciaturas e Colóquios da Graduação) e Viagens Didáticas semestrais ou nas atividades de pesquisas desenvolvidas nos programas de Iniciação Científica, as quais contam com apoio financeiro do CNPq (PIBIC), FAPESP, e das Pró Reitorias de Pesquisa e de Graduação da USP, ou ainda nas atividades de Iniciação à Docência desenvolvidas no Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciação à Docência – PIBID CAPES, em que os licenciandos recebem orientação de um professor da Universidade e de um professor da Educação Básica para elaborar e desenvolver atividades na escola básica, propiciando uma inserção mais profícua na escola. Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar, podem ser contemplados com as bolsas do PUB Programa Unificado de Bolsas da USP, nas alíneas Cultura e Extensão, Ensino e Pesquisa. Temos também, no Departamento de Matemática, um programa institucional de Iniciação Científica (PIC), através do qual os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores desse departamento. 3 Serviço de Graduação Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação | Universidade de São Paulo | Av.

Investigar sistematicamente progressos e dificuldades dos alunos, e de sua própria prática, e utilizar tal investigação como parte do processo de sua formação continuada. 6. Processo Pedagógico 6.1. Considerações metodológicas: As disciplinas do curso de Licenciatura são ministradas segundo uma variedade de métodos de ensino e aprendizagem, cada qual dentro de suas peculiaridades. Aquelas de formação mais teórica, em geral, utilizam se de aulas expositivas, mas não dispensam o uso de equipamentos como projetores de imagens, microcomputadores (como é o caso dos Cálculos), ambientes virtuais de aprendizagem (A.V.A.) ou outros, viabilizando situações concretas (simuladas) dos conceitos abstratos, com fundamental importância para a sólida formação básica do aluno. Muitas das disciplinas listadas na estrutura curricular da Licenciatura em Matemática, principalmente aquelas voltadas à formação pedagógica do futuro professor, possibilitam o desenvolvimento de diversas atividades práticas desenvolvidas no Laboratório Interdisciplinar de Formação de Educadores LIFE e Laboratório de Ensino de Matemática LEM, simulando situações reais de ensino, junto a alunos da Rede Oficial de Ensino Fundamental e Médio que visitam o ICMC, para atenderem a minicursos, palestras, ou orientações em Matemática, ou executando as junto a tais alunos em suas unidades escolares. Outros recursos metodológicos seminários, monografias, relatos, estudos de caso – estão presentes em várias disciplinas, em eventos para os alunos de graduação como o SIM (Simpósio de Matemática para a Graduação – organizado anualmente), os seminários mensais de graduação (Colóquios das Licenciaturas e Colóquios da Graduação) e Viagens Didáticas semestrais ou nas atividades de pesquisas desenvolvidas nos programas de Iniciação Científica, as quais contam com apoio financeiro do CNPq (PIBIC), FAPESP, e das Pró Reitorias de Pesquisa e de Graduação da USP, ou ainda nas atividades de Iniciação à Docência desenvolvidas no Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciação à Docência – PIBID CAPES, em que os licenciandos recebem orientação de um professor da Universidade e de um professor da Educação Básica para elaborar e desenvolver atividades na escola básica, propiciando uma inserção mais profícua na escola. Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar, podem ser contemplados com as bolsas do PUB Programa Unificado de Bolsas da USP, nas alíneas Cultura e Extensão, Ensino e Pesquisa. Temos também, no Departamento de Matemática, um programa institucional de Iniciação Científica (PIC), através do qual os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores desse departamento. 3 Serviço de Graduação Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação | Universidade de São Paulo | Av.

Introdução: Este Projeto Político do Curso (PPC) tem por objetivo traçar diretrizes e metas para a formação de professores de Matemática para os anos finais do Ensino Fundamental e para o Ensino Médio, no ICMC USP. Tem como base as orientações do Programa de Formação de Professores, aprovado pelo Conselho de Graduação da USP em 2004, e as Deliberações CEE N° 111/2012, CEE Nº 126/2014, Resolução CNE/CP no. 2/2015 e CEE No 154/2017. 2. Breve Histórico: O ICMC USP foi criado como unidade isolada desta universidade, desde a reforma universitária de 1971, à época designado “Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas de São Carlos – ICMSC – e hoje denominado Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação. Anteriormente a esta data, o departamento de Matemática fazia parte da Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, implantada em 1948 e com início das atividades em 1953, e agregava pesquisadores da área de Matemática e Computação. Atualmente, o ICMC conta com quatro departamentos: de Sistemas da Informação (SSC), de Ciências da Computação (SCC), de Matemática (SMA) e o de Matemática Aplicada e Estatística (SME), englobando docentes pesquisadores em todas essas áreas. O campus da USP de São Carlos tem tido, historicamente, uma forte atuação na formação de profissionais das Ciências Exatas. Nesse contexto, conta com a interação com outros profissionais que utilizam a Matemática como ferramenta de seu dia a dia, como Físicos, Químicos ou Engenheiros. Por outro lado, a cidade de São Carlos tem se firmado como um polo de desenvolvimento de alta tecnologia, dentre outros fatores, devido à existência desta “vocação para as exatas”, estabelecida com a criação desse campus. Isso leva a população local a uma maior conscientização sobre a importância do ensino e da aprendizagem da Matemática, o que tem fortalecido o compromisso do ICMC em propiciar cursos de formação de professores de Matemática de alto nível, envidando esforços para a busca constante de seu aperfeiçoamento e da maior interação com a comunidade local. O curso de Licenciatura em Matemática foi reconhecido pela Portaria do MEC nº 1474, de 13/10/1992 (D.O.E. 14/10/1992). Desde então, seu reconhecimento tem sido renovado a cada 5 anos, pelo Conselho Estadual de Educação CEE/SP. 3.

Muitas das disciplinas listadas na estrutura curricular da Licenciatura em Matemática, principalmente aquelas voltadas à formação pedagógica do futuro professor, possibilitam o desenvolvimento de diversas atividades práticas desenvolvidas no Laboratório Interdisciplinar de Formação de Educadores LIFE e Laboratório de Ensino de Matemática LEM, simulando situações reais de ensino, junto a alunos da Rede Oficial de Ensino Fundamental e Médio que visitam o ICMC, para atenderem a minicursos, palestras, ou orientações em Matemática, ou executando as junto a tais alunos em suas unidades escolares. Outros recursos metodológicos seminários, monografias, relatos, estudos de caso – estão presentes em várias disciplinas, em eventos para os alunos de graduação como o SIM (Simpósio de Matemática para a Graduação – organizado anualmente), os seminários mensais de graduação (Colóquios das Licenciaturas e Colóquios da Graduação) e Viagens Didáticas semestrais ou nas atividades de pesquisas desenvolvidas nos programas de Iniciação Científica, as quais contam com apoio financeiro do CNPq (PIBIC), FAPESP, e das Pró Reitorias de Pesquisa e de Graduação da USP, ou ainda nas atividades de Iniciação à Docência desenvolvidas no Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciação à Docência – PIBID CAPES, em que os licenciandos recebem orientação de um professor da Universidade e de um professor da Educação Básica para elaborar e desenvolver atividades na escola básica, propiciando uma inserção mais profícua na escola. Os alunos com bom desempenho acadêmico e com determinada renda familiar, podem ser contemplados com as bolsas do PUB Programa Unificado de Bolsas da USP, nas alíneas Cultura e Extensão, Ensino e Pesquisa. Temos também, no Departamento de Matemática, um programa institucional de Iniciação Científica (PIC), através do qual os alunos que não obtêm bolsas podem realizar pesquisa com os orientadores desse departamento. 3 Serviço de Graduação Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação | Universidade de São Paulo | Av.
